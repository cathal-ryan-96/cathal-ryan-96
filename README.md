-Tolerance


Tolerance is a repository that i created as part of my dissertation for my MSc in Statistics within University College Dublin. It is based around the use of Tobit regression to help determine when antibiotics are classified as being minimal in cows milk. It includes the neccessary code both in SAS and R. The SAS code is used to determine the Tobit Mixed Effects model which will be further analysed in R using this package.
